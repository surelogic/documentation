	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Instrumentation of Java 1.4 code running on
	  a Java 1.4 VM</emphasis> &mdash; It is now possible to
	  collect data using Flashlight about Java 1.4 code running on
	  a Java 1.4 VM. (Note that the Ecilpse that runs Flashlight
	  must still use a Java 5, or above, VM.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Tips and problem reports are tracked by
	  SureLogic</emphasis> &mdash; When you submit a tip for
	  improvement or a problem report to SureLogic it is tracked
	  via an automatically created Bugzilla issue report at
	  <ulink
	      url="http://www.surelogic.com/bugzilla/index.cgi">surelogic.com</ulink>. If
	  you include your email address in the tip or problem
	  report you will be notified when changes to the status of
	  the Bugzilla issue are made by SureLogic engineers. The
	  public Bugzilla may also be accessed via a browser at
	  <ulink
	      url="http://www.surelogic.com/bugzilla/index.cgi">surelogic.com</ulink>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>The "Tip for Improvement" and "Problem
	  Report" dialogs are no longer modal</emphasis> &mdash;
	  This allows the user to cut and paste information from
	  Eclipse that they want to send to SureLogic into the
	  dialog.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Tool tips have been added to all
	  queries</emphasis> &mdash; All query names in the
	  <guilabel>Query Menu</guilabel>, <guilabel>Query Results
	  Explorer</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Query
	  Editor</guilabel> views will now display tooltips when hovered
	  over.  The tool tip view is similar to the javadoc view in
	  Eclipse's Java Editor, and can be focused and resized.

    <title>Flashlight version 3.0.0</title>
    
    <para>This section describes the 3.0.0 release of Flashlight.</para>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>New and Noteworthy</title>

      <para>This section describes new and noteworthy features in this
      version of Flashlight.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Launch JUnit tests directly from
	    Flashlight.</emphasis> &mdash; You can now run Flashlight on
	    a JUnit test using the launcher.  Right click on the test
	    class, and choose <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Flashlight
	    As</guisubmenu> <guimenuitem>JUnit
	    Test</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or configure your test from
	    the <guimenu>Flashlight Configurations</guimenu> pane.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>AWT Event Dispatch Thread query added.</emphasis>
	    &mdash; The Swing and AWT libraries mandate that all
	    modifications to their components happen in the AWT Event
	    Dispatch Thread.  Flashlight does not currently instrument
	    the Swing and AWT libraries, so it cannot detect all
	    violations of this policy.  What this query provides is a
	    synopsis of all of your program's fields that are read while
	    in the AWT Event Dispatch Thread but modified outside it.
	    This can give you a general idea as to what portions of the
	    program interact with Swing and AWT and can help identify
	    violations of the threading policy.

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Differently instrumented versions of the same file
	    can cause failures.</emphasis> &mdash; If two identical
	    class files happen to be on the classpath at once, and one
	    is instrumented while the other is not, then a VerifyError
	    can occur at runtime.  The best way to work around this is
	    to make sure that both classes are instrumented or not
	    instrumented.  You can do this from the
	    <guilabel>Instrumentation</guilabel> tab in the
	    <guimenu>Flashlight Configurations</guimenu> view.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Preparing very large files will sometimes fail.</emphasis>
	    &mdash; Due to a limitation in Flashlight's embedded database
	    implementation, Flashlight is unable to prepare very large files.
	    The maximum size file that can be prepared depends on
	    characteristics of the instrumented program, but as a general rule
	    you shouldn't encounter this problem until your raw file is &gt; 300
	    MB in size.

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>The Flashlight Status view provides a quick overview of a
	    run's results.</emphasis> &mdash; A new view has been added to make
	    it easier to tell if there are interesting results from a prepared
	    run.  The Flashlight Status view indicates if the lock cycle
	    analysis has found any potential deadlocks or if the lock set
	    analysis has detected any possible race conditions.  You can
	    double-click on a warning indicator to run the relevant query.
