	    <emphasis>Preparing very large files will sometimes fail.</emphasis>
	    &mdash; Due to a limitation in Flashlight's embedded database
	    implementation, Flashlight is unable to prepare very large files.
	    The maximum size file that can be prepared depends on
	    characteristics of the instrumented program, but as a general rule
	    you shouldn't encounter this problem until your raw file is &gt; 300
	    MB in size.
