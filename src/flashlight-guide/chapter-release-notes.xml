	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Launch JUnit tests directly from
	    Flashlight.</emphasis> &mdash; You can now run Flashlight on
	    a JUnit test using the launcher.  Right click on the test
	    class, and choose <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Flashlight
	    As</guisubmenu> <guimenuitem>JUnit
	    Test</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or configure your test from
	    the <guimenu>Flashlight Configurations</guimenu> pane.

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Differently instrumented versions of the same file
	    can cause failures.</emphasis> &mdash; If two identical
	    class files happen to be on the classpath at once, and one
	    is instrumented while the other is not, then a VerifyError
	    can occur at runtime.  The best way to work around this is
	    to make sure that both classes are instrumented or not
	    instrumented.  You can do this from the
	    <guilabel>Instrumentation</guilabel> tab in the
	    <guimenu>Flashlight Configurations</guimenu> view.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Preparing very large files will sometimes fail.</emphasis>
	    &mdash; Due to a limitation in Flashlight's embedded database
	    implementation, Flashlight is unable to prepare very large files.
	    The maximum size file that can be prepared depends on
	    characteristics of the instrumented program, but as a general rule
	    you shouldn't encounter this problem until your raw file is &gt; 300
	    MB in size.

	  <para>
	    <emphasis>The Flashlight Status view provides a quick overview of a
	    run's results.</emphasis> &mdash; A new view has been added to make
	    it easier to tell if there are interesting results from a prepared
	    run.  The Flashlight Status view indicates if the lock cycle
	    analysis has found any potential deadlocks or if the lock set
	    analysis has detected any possible race conditions.  You can
	    double-click on a warning indicator to run the relevant query.
