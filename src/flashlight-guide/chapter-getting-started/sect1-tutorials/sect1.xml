  <title>Tutorials</title>

  <para>This section contains a series of Flashlight tutorials.  It is
  recommended that you go through these tutorials in order.  It is also
  recommended that these tutorials be performed "hands-on" at your
  computer. You might want to create a new Eclipse workspace to use for
  these tutorials. In addition, if you run into any difficulties as you
  step through the tutorials please consider sending us a tip for
  improvement as described in <xref
  linkend="sec-bugs-and-tips"/>.</para>

  <para>These tutorials assume that you have installed Flashlight. If
  you see a <guimenu>Flashlight</guimenu> menu item on your Eclipse main
  menu than you can assume it has been installed properly.  To follow
  along with the tutorials you will also need to add the PlanetBaron
  project to your workspace.  From the Eclipse main menu, choose
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Flashlight</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run the
  Flashlight Tutorials</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and add
  <application>PlanetBaron</application> to your workspace.  If you
  don't want to add the project to your workspace this way, you can also
  download the <application>PlanetBaron</application> project from
  <ulink
  url="http://www.surelogic.com/static/flashlight/PlanetBaron.zip">
  http://www.surelogic.com/static/flashlight/PlanetBaron.zip</ulink> and
  import it into your workspace manually.</para>
