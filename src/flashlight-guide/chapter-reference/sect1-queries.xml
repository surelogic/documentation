	  <para>
	    Lists how often each lock was held when this particular field was
	    accessed, as well as what proportion of the total number of field
	    accesses that represents.  If the same lock is held on every access,
	    we have an assurance that no race condition was observed for this
	    field during this run of the program.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    How often is a lock held when this field is accessed after object construction?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Lists how often each lock was held when this particular field was
	    accessed after the object was fully constructed.  If the same lock
	    is held on every access, we have an assurance that no race condition
	    was observed for this field.  This is generally the more useful form
	    of this query, as a safely published field usually doesn't need to
	    have the same lock held during object construction as is held when
	    it is accessed.

	<question>

	    What are the improperly published instances of this non-static field?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Lists the shared objects containing a given field that are
	    improperly published.  Improperly published objects are accessed by
	    more than one thread while the object is under construction.  This
	    generally happens when a constructor passes its
	    <varname>this</varname> reference to another object during
	    construction.  The number of reads/writes and the size of the lock
	    set is also shown.

	    What kinds of objects are indirectly accessed by more than one thread?

	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Shows all of the classes with objects that are indirectly accessed
	    by more than one thread, as well as how many threads call them and
	    how many accesses are actually made.  Flashlight can generate
	    indirect access events about an object whenever it is invoked with
	    or passed as a parameter to a particular method.  By default, it
	    does this for the collections and array manipulation methods in
	    <package>java.util</package> and
	    <classname>java.lang.System</classname>. For more information about
	    indirect accesses, see <xref linkend="flashlight-method-files" />.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What locks are contended for the longest time?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Lists all of the locks in the program, in descending order of the
	    average amount of time a lock blocks a thread each time it is
	    acquired.  Locks with a high average block time usually indicate
	    high contention in part of your program, and may be a source of
	    slowdown.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What locks could potentially cause deadlock?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
      	    Deadlocks can occur when two different threads in a program acquire
      	    a set of locks in different order.  Flashlight tries to detect
      	    potential deadlocks by constructing a directed graph where each edge
      	    points to an acquired lock from a lock already held.  This query
      	    shows all of the potential cycles in that graph.	    
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For example, imagine that a program has locks 1, 2, and 3.  In
	    method <function>foo</function>, lock 1 is acquired, then 2, then 3.
	    In method <function>bar</function>, lock 3 is acquired, then 1, then
	    2.  If <function>foo</function> and <function>bar</function> are
	    called at the same time, foo may end up holding lock 1 and 2 while
	    bar holds lock 3.  Running this query will cause the above example
	    to show up as a cycle.  The figure below is an example of this type
	    of deadlock.
