  <title>License management</title>

  <para>Sierra is commercial software and a license is required to use
  it. Licenses are obtained from SureLogic and expire after some period
  of time. Lack of a license will prohibit you from running queries or
  creating new Flashlight runs. Selecting <guimenuitem>Manage SureLogic
  Licenses</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Flashlight</guimenu> menu
  brings up the license management form as seen in <xref
  linkend="fig-license-management" />. (It is also possible to bring
  this dialog up from the main Flashlight preferences pane by pressing
  the <guibutton>Manage SureLogic Licenses</guibutton> button.) For
  Flashlight to operate properly either a
  <emphasis>Flashlight</emphasis> or <emphasis>All Tools</emphasis>
  license must be installed.</para>

  <para>By default license installation requires internet access.
  SureLogic can, in special cases, provide licenses that do not require
  internet access. Further use of the product does not require internet
  access. If a manual uninstall is done, before license expiration,
  internet access is also required.  SureLogic tracks the number of
  times a particular license is installed and uninstalled. We stress
  that Flashlight does not, unlike other plug-ins such as MyEclipse,
  "talk-back" to SureLogic each time Eclipse is started.</para>

  <para>The installed license expires after a period of time (clearly
  visible to the user) and a new license has to be installed to continue
  to use Flashlight.</para>

  <para>Licenses can be installed more than once.  Thus, one license can
  be used for all of an organization or SureLogic can issue one per
  location or one per organizational entity.</para>

  <para>If the Flashlight Eclipse plug-in does not have a valid license
  it will not effect the Eclipse installation that Flashlight is
  installed into. The IDE will load and function normally, but when
  Flashlight functions are executed they will fail noting the lack of a
  license. Serviceability functions of the tool (e.g., sending problem
  reports to SureLogic, installing and uninstalling licenses) function
  properly without a license.  The unlicensed Flashlight plug-in can be
  uninstalled or disabled within Eclipse.</para>

  <para>When you receive a license file from SureLogic it is installed
  via this dialog.  To install the license select the row in the license
  table that matches the type of license.  For example, if you have been
  sent a Flashlight license select the Flashlight row in the license
  table.  Next press the <guibutton>Install License</guibutton> button. 
  You will be prompted for the location of your license file.  The tool
  checks with SureLogic and reports that your license has been installed
  and returns showing information about the installed license. The
  license file is not examined by the tool after the installation is
  completed unless you install the file again (after an
  uninstall).</para>

  <para>To uninstall a license, select the row in the license table and
  press the <guibutton>Uninstall License</guibutton>. You will be asked
  if you are sure you want to uninstall the license.  If you confirm the
  uninstall then the license is removed.  This may take a minute as
  SureLogic is informed that your license has been uninstalled.</para>

  <para>When a license is nearing expiration the tool warns the user
  with the dialog shown in <xref
  linkend="fig-license-management-expiration-warning" />.</para>

  <para>When a license does expire it disappears from the dialog. The
  tool is considered unlicensed at that point. To fix this situation
  install a new license (it is not required to install a new version of
  Flashlight).</para>
