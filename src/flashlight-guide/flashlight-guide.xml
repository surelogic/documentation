    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para><emphasis>What is Flashlight?</emphasis> Flashlight is a
    dynamic analysis tool that helps you to better understand the
    concurrency within your Java software. It is similar to a profiler
    in the sense that it collects data from a program execution and
    presents information about that run to the tool user. Flashlight
    casts light on issues related to performance, concurrency, and
    code safety. The Flashlight dynamic analysis tool is designed so
    that even one run can reveal information regarding a relatively
    much larger universe of runs, and thus enable developers to
    address potential issues earlier. The tool is also designed to
    afford developers and evaluators a visibility that enables them to
    develop models to support "more complete" analyses such as sound
    static analysis, such as SureLogic's JSure tool.</para>

    <para>At a more technical level, Flashlight is designed to scale
    to very large amounts of collected instrumentation data. It
    accomplishes this through a unique pipeline/buffering approach
    that rapidly moves data out of the instrumented program's process
    heap and into secondary storage. It is designed to interact
    cleanly with garbage collection and object finalization.</para>

    <para>Flashlight use imposes an overhead cost, in terms of time
    and memory, on your program.  Flashlight is a much more invasive
    analysis than a typical Java profiler.  Roughly, an instrumented
    program will require two to three times the memory it normally
    uses and will run from 20 times to 80 times slower than it
    normally runs.  A dual- or quad-core CPU is recommend to speed the
    instrumented program.  Flashlight uses a large amount of disk
    space to store the data it collects, thus 50 to 100 Gigabytes of
    free disk space are recommended.</para>

    <para>The tool also has a highly effective query capability,
    wherein the database is queried using a hierarchy of queries that
    enable the results of one query to be used as a basis for "drill
    in" using sub-queries.</para>
