  <title>Quick start</title>

  <para>This section will quickly get you started with JSure. It
  describes how to install JSure into your Eclipse, how to install a
  license file that allows you to use JSure.  It also describes how to 
  enable JSure assurane of a Java project, and how to examine the
  assurance results.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Installing Your License</title>

    <para>This section assumes that you have installed JSure. If you
    see a <guimenu>JSure</guimenu> menu item on your Eclipse main menu
    then you can assume JSure has been installed properly.</para>

    <para>You need to install a license to use JSure.  If you do not
    have a license file that was sent to you by SureLogic visit <ulink
    url="http://www.surelogic.com">http://www.surelogic.com</ulink> to
    obtain one.  To install the license select <guimenuitem>Manage
    SureLogic Licenses</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>JSure</guimenu>
    menu as shown in <xref linkend="fig-quick-start-license-menu"/>
    </para>

	  linkend="fig-quick-start-license-dialog-empty" />.  Highlight the
	  JSure row and select the <guibutton>Install License</guibutton>
	  button to install your license file.</para>

    <para>JSure will not disrupt your Eclipse installation if a
    license for it is not installed, however, it will not allow you to
    use JSure functionality.  We will assume from this point on that
    you have installed your license.  For more information, see <xref

  <sect2 id="sec-quick-start-annotations">
    <title>Annotating and Assuring Your Code</title>
    
    <para>For the impatient, this section provides a
    &ldquo;bare-bones&rdquo; description of how to prepare a Java
    project for assurance by JSure.</para>
    
    <para>JSure assurance compares Java code
    against programmer design intent as expressed using a set of Java 5
    annotation types.  To use JSure with your code, your project must be
    able to reference the SureLogic annotation types.  The SureLogic
    annotation types are bundled together in
    <filename>promises.jar</filename>. This file must be on the build
    path of your project for the annotations be to used.  As described
    below, the simplest way to add this JAR file to the project and its
    build path is to allow JSure to do it for you. </para>
    
    <sect3>
      <title>Enabling JSure Analysis</title>
      
      <para>JSure can only assure the contents of one project at a
      time. The icon of the project being assured is marked with a
      small <wordasword>S</wordasword> (for SureLogic) in the lower
      right corner: <guiicon><inlinegraphic
      fileref="images/jsure-nature.png"/></guiicon>.  The easiest way
      to select the project to assure is to
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem><para>Select the project in the <guilabel>Package
          Explorer</guilabel>.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>Press the icon <guiicon><inlinegraphic
          fileref="images/jsure_verify.gif"/></guiicon> in the view&rsquo;s
          toolbar.  This same action is also available as
          <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Focus Verificaton on this
          Project</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the view&rsquo;s menu.</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      If any other project is currently selected for assurance, this action first
      disables assurance on that project before enabling the newly selected
      project.</para>
      
      <para>When a project is selected for analysis, JSure checks to see if
      <filename>promises.jar</filename> is on the project&rsquo;s build path.
      If it is not, it offers to add the file to the project and the build path:
      
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/add-promises-jar.png" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

      The easiest thing to do is to choose the default option
      <guibutton>Add to Project Root</guibutton>: JSure copies
      <filename>promises.jar</filename> to the root of project and
      adds it to the build path.  See <xref linkend="sec-adding-promises-jar"/>
      for more details.</para>

      <title>Disabling JSure Analysis</title>
      
      <para>To deselect a project without selecting another project to assure
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem><para>Select the project in the <guilabel>Package
          Explorer</guilabel>.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>Press the icon <guiicon><inlinegraphic
          fileref="images/jsure_no_verify.gif"/></guiicon> in the
          view&rsquo;s toolbar.  This same action is also available as
          <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Disable
          Verificaton</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the view&rsquo;s
          menu.</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </para>
      
      <para>Disabling analysis of a project does not affect
      <filename>promises.jar</filename> or the project&rsquo;s build
      path.</para>
    </sect3>
        
    <sect3>
      <title>Viewing Assurance Results</title>
      
      <para>JSure reassures the chosen project whenever a file in that project
      is changed.  This guarantees that the assurance results are always up to
      date.  The assurance results are displayed in the <guilabel>Verification
      Status</guilabel> view.  The easiest way to open this view is to switch
      to the <guilabel>Code Verification</guilabel> perspective.  The first time you enable
      JSure analysis on any project in the workspace JSure prompts you
      about switching to the <guilabel>Code Verification</guilabel>
      perspective:
      
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/perspective-switch.png" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

      Choosing <guibutton>Yes</guibutton> will immediately switch Eclipse to 
      the perspective.  Choosing <guibutton>No</guibutton> will leave
      the current Eclipse window in whatever perspective it is currently in.  If you check
      <guibutton>Remember my decision</guibutton> and press <guibutton>Yes</guibutton>
      then whenever you focus verificaton on a project, Eclipse will switch
      to the perspective without asking you first.</para>

      <para>You can also switch to the <guilabel>Code Verification</guilabel>
      perspective by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>JSure</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Open Code Verification Perspective</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  
      See <xref linkend="fig-open-code-verification"/>.</para>

      <para>The code verification perspective defaults to showing the
      <guilabel>Package Explorer</guilabel> and <guilabel>Verification
      Status</guilabel> views; see <xref
      linkend="fig-code-verification-perspective"/>. The
      <guilabel>Verification Status</guilabel> view is divided into
      sections to show the results of assuring different classes
      of design intent, such as effects, and concurrency, as well as
      showing less specific suggestions and warnings. The various
      result messages are explained in detail in <xref
      linkend="understanding-assurance-output"/>.</para>
