    <para><emphasis>What is JSure?</emphasis>  JSure is a model-based
    static analysis tool that helps developers answer the question
    &ldquo;Are my threads accessing shared state in a safe way?&rdquo;
    JSure provides positive assurance (sound analysis, not rule-based)
    that correct locks are held when shared state is accessed. This
    enables programmers to develop confidence that their code is
    &ldquo;thread safe,&rdquo; that is, that it satisfies state
    consistency requirements.</para>

    <para>More specifically, JSure assures that Java class
    implementations are consistent with programmer design intent as
    expressed using Java 5 annotations. Annotations make JSure scalable:
    Unannotated classes have no design intent to assure. Annotations may
    be inserted incrementally in critical classes.  Later, additional
    annotations may be added as required to assure additional classes. 
    Assurance is, however, whole program: some annotations place
    requirements on class clients, and thus, the behavior of a client
    class is assured even if that class has no annotations of its own.</para>
    
    <para>The JSure analysis engine is integrated into the Eclipse build 
    process.  This enables the assurance results to be always up to date
    as assurance is rerun whenever a file is recompiled.</para>
