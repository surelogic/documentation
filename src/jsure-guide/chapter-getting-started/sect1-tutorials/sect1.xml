  <title>Tutorials</title>

  <para>This section contains two tutorials demonstrating the use of
  JSure and SureLogic program annotations to assure the correct use of
  locks in two concurrent programs.  The first tutorial uses a small
  closed-world example to demonstrate the complete assurance of a class
  and its usage, starting with no annotations at all.  The second begins
  with a partially annotated program, and demonstrates more
  sophisticated concepts such as support for
  <package>java.util.concurrent</package> reader&ndash;writer
  locks.</para>
  
  <para>These tutorials assume that you have installed JSure. If you
  see a <guimenu>JSure</guimenu> menu item on your Eclipse main menu
  than you can assume it has been installed properly.  To follow along
  with the tutorials you will also need to add the BoundedFIFO and
  PlanetBaronJSure and BoundedFIFO projects to your workspace.  From
  the Eclipse main menu, choose
  <menuchoice><guimenu>JSure</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run JSure
  Tutorials</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and add the projects to your
  workspace as displayed in <xref linkend="fig-tutorial-jsure-install"
  />.  If you don't want to add the project to your workspace this
  way, you can also download the
  <application>BoundedFIFO</application> project from <ulink
  url="http://www.surelogic.com/static/jsure/BoundedFIFO.zip">
  http://www.surelogic.com/static/jsure/BoundedFIFO.zip</ulink> or the
  <application>PlanetBaronJSure</application> project from <ulink
  url="http://www.surelogic.com/static/jsure/PlanetBaronJSure.zip">
  http://www.surelogic.com/static/jsure/PlanetBaronJSure.zip</ulink>
  and import them into your workspace manually. Note that the
  PlanetBaronJSure project will <emphasis>not</emphasis> compile
  without errors until you enable JSure which will add the
  <package>promises.jar</package> file to the project's build path (as
  described below).</para>
