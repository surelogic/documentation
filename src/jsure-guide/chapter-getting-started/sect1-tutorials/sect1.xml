  <title>Tutorials</title>

  <para>This section contains two tutorials demonstrating the use of
  JSure and SureLogic program annotations to assure the correct use of
  locks in two concurrent programs.  The first tutorial uses a small
  closed-world example to demonstrate the complete assurance of a class
  and its usage, starting with no annotations at all.  The second begins
  with a partially annotated program, and demonstrates more
  sophisticated concepts such as support for
  <package>java.util.concurrent</package> reader&ndash;writer
  locks.</para>
