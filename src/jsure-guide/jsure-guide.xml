    <title>Release notes</title>
    <para>For each release of JSure there are new and noteworthy
    features to try out, and known limitations to avoid or
    workaround. These are presented in the sections below for each
    released version of JSure.</para>

	    <para><emphasis>Verification results are now separated
	    from modeling problems</emphasis> &mdash; A new view,
	    called the <guilabel>Modeling Problems</guilabel> view,
	    has been added to JSure. Previously any annotations that
	    were not well-formed (i.e., they had syntax errors or
	    other problems) were reported as modeling problems in the
	    <guilabel>Verification Status</guilabel> view. This was
	    confusing to the user because these results, which are
	    very important, could easily be missed when mixed in with
	    the analysis results shown in this view. A screenshot
	    showing this new view noting a typo in a
	    <emphasis>@InRegion</emphasis> annotation is shown in
	    <xref
	    linkend="fig-release-notes-230-modeling-problems"/>.</para>

	      </mediaobject>
	    </figure>
	    <para>The new view, by default, appears when the code has
	    any modeling problems. Therefore, the view can be
	    dismissed to save screen space and it will come back when
	    needed. This behavior can be changed as shown in  <xref
	    linkend="fig-release-notes-230-modeling-problems-pref"/>.</para>
