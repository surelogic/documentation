  <title>License management</title>

  <para>Flashlight is commercial software and a license is required to use
  it. Licenses are obtained from SureLogic and expire after some period of
  time. Lack of a license will prohibit you from running queries or creating new
  Flashlight runs. Selecting <guimenuitem>Manage SureLogic
  Licenses</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Flashlight</guimenu> menu brings up
  the license management form as seen in <xref linkend="fig-license-management"
  />. (It is also possible to bring this dialog up from the main Flashlight
  preferences pane by pressing the <guibutton>Manage SureLogic
  Licenses</guibutton> button.) For Flashlight to operate properly either a
  <emphasis>Flashlight</emphasis> or <emphasis>All Tools</emphasis> license must
  be installed.</para>

  <para>License installation does not require internet access, but at some point
  the license will need to be activated.  Activation does require internet
  access.  Further use of the product does not require internet access. If a
  manual uninstall is done before license expiration, internet access is also
  required.  SureLogic tracks the number of times a particular license is
  installed and uninstalled. We stress that Flashlight does not, unlike other
  plug-ins such as MyEclipse, "talk-back" to SureLogic each time Eclipse is
  started.</para>

  <para>The installed license expires after a period of time (clearly visible to
  the user) and a new license has to be installed to continue to use
  Flashlight.</para>

  <para>Licenses can be installed more than once.  Thus, one license can be used
  for all of an organization or SureLogic can issue one per location or one per
  organizational entity.</para>

  <para>If the Flashlight Eclipse plug-in does not have a valid license it will
  not affect the Eclipse installation that Flashlight is installed into. The IDE
  will load and function normally, but when Flashlight functions are executed
  they will fail noting the lack of a license. Serviceability functions of the
  tool (e.g., sending problem reports to SureLogic, installing and uninstalling
  licenses) function properly without a license.  The unlicensed Flashlight
  plug-in can be uninstalled or disabled within Eclipse.</para>

  <para>A license can be installed from a file or copy/pasted from the
  clipboard. To install the license, click <guibutton>Install From
  File</guibutton> and choose a file, or click <guibutton>Install From
  Clipboard</guibutton> and, if it has not happened automatically, paste the
  license data into the text window. Once the tool verifies that the license is
  valid, an entry displaying information about the license is placed in the
  license management view.  This entry also indicates whether or not the license
  has been activated.  A license can be activated by clicking the
  <guilabel>Activate</guilabel> button.  Most licenses must be activated within
  a certain time limit or they will cease to work. The license file is not
  examined by the tool after the activation is completed unless you install the
  license again (after an uninstall).</para>

  <para>To uninstall a license, select the row in the license table and press
  the <guibutton>Uninstall License</guibutton>. You will be asked if you are
  sure you want to uninstall the license.  If you confirm the uninstall then the
  license is removed.  This may take a minute as SureLogic is informed that your
  license has been uninstalled.</para>

  <para>When a license is nearing expiration the tool warns the user with the
  dialog shown in <xref linkend="fig-license-management-expiration-warning"
  />.</para>

  </figure>

  <para>When a license does expire it disappears from the dialog. The tool is
  considered unlicensed at that point. To fix this situation install a new
  license (it is not required to install a new version of Flashlight).</para>
