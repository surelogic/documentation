      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para><emphasis>What is Sierra?</emphasis> Sierra is a rule-based
      static analysis toolkit supporting team collaboration. It
      integrates widely used open source tools, such as FindBugs and
      PMD, into a single team-oriented tool.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Why should you use Sierra?</emphasis> Sierra helps
      you quickly uncover potential problems in your Java code. It uses
      static analysis to examine your code, without having to run it,
      and report any potential problems it uncovers to you for
      action. Sierra deeply integrates well tested static analysis
      tools, such as FindBugs and PMD, into the Eclipse environment.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Why not just use FindBugs (or PMD)?</emphasis>
      Sierra has the following advantages over just using an analysis
      tool directly:</para>

      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Persistence:</emphasis> Sierra remembers what
	  findings you have audited across scans of your code. This is
	  very helpful to avoid wasting your time examining the same
	  findings over and over again.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Multi-Tool:</emphasis> Sierra integrates
	  several analysis tools into one framework. This allows you to
	  take advantage of the best tools, without the trouble of
	  getting them all installed and properly configured to work on
	  your software.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Eclipse:</emphasis> Sierra deeply integrates
	  rule-based static analysis into Eclipse. It provides a
	  cutting-edge Eclipse user interface designed for busy
	  programmers.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>Team-Oriented:</emphasis> Sierra has an
	  optional team server capability that allows you and your
	  development team to share your analysis tool settings (so
	  everyone scans using the same settings) and finding audit
	  trails. The team server also support a web interface to
	  examine metrics about your source code over time.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The next section introduces concepts and definitions that
      are important to understand when using Sierra.  The section
      after that gets you started quick with the Sierra tool by
      describing how to install Sierra, install your license, and scan
      your code. If you have used FindBugs or PMD and want to get
      going on your own code this is your quickest route.  The final
      section of this chapter contain a series of tutorials that
      describe how to use the Sierra on example Java projects.</para>

    <section id="sec-concepts">
      <title>Concepts</title>

      <para>This section introduces concepts and definitions that are
      important to understand about Sierra.</para>

      <para>When Sierra examines your code, this is called a
      <emphasis>scan</emphasis>.  By default, a Sierra scan runs three
      analysis tools: FindBugs, PMD, and Reckoner.</para>

      <para>The output of a scan is a <emphasis>scan
      document</emphasis>.  A scan document is an XML file that
      contains all the issues reported by the various analysis tools.
      The scan document is unfiltered and may contain hundreds of
      thousands of tool-reported issues.  Scan documents are stored in
      your Sierra data directory.  This directory, by default, is
      in your workspace under <filename>.sierra-data</filename>. (This is sometimes useful
      to know because you can clear out all scan data and "reset" Sierra
      by deleting this entire directory)</para>

      <para>The results reported by analysis tools during a scan are
      called <emphasis>artifacts</emphasis> by Sierra.  Sierra
      aggregates these results to produce
      <emphasis>findings</emphasis>, each of which is made up of one
      or more artifacts.  The reason for this distinction between an
      artifact and a finding is two-fold: to merge the "same" artifact
      reported by two different tools and to track a particular code
      issue over time (i.e., across multiple scans).  Two analysis
      tools may report artifacts that are essentially the same issue.
      For example, the line of Java code shown below would generate an
      artifact from both the FindBugs and PMD analysis tools that
      explicit construction of string objects is inefficient.</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[String hi = new String("hi");]]></programlisting>

      <para>It would be annoying for the user to deal with two reports
      for this issue, so Sierra maps similar artifacts from
      different analysis tools into one finding.</para>

      <para>The second distinction between an artifact and a finding
      involves tracking the same code issue across multiple scans.  An
      artifact is tied to one particular scan.  A finding can exist
      across multiple scans.  Sierra uses a matching heuristic to try
      and "attach" an artifact reported by a new scan to an existing
      finding.  A new finding is only created if no match can be
      found.  This is desirable because it allows the user to
      understand change, or the lack of change, in code over time with
      respect to the issues reported by Sierra.</para>

      <para>Sierra distinguishes between artifacts and artifact types
      as well as between findings and finding types.  An
      <emphasis>artifact type</emphasis> is often called a
      <emphasis>rule</emphasis> by analysis tools.  Each analysis tool
      included in Sierra reports artifacts based upon the set of
      artifact types (or rules) that they contain.  For example, one
      artifact type included in FindBugs and PMD is <emphasis>explicit
      construction of string objects is inefficient.</emphasis>  Each artifact
      reported by a scan has one and only one artifact type.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>finding type</emphasis> is similar to an
      artifact type, but it describes a type of finding rather than a
      type of artifact.  For example, Sierra contains a finding type
      that explicit construction of string objects is
      inefficient. This finding type is established by two artifact
      types: one from FindBugs and one from PMD.  There must be an
      artifact type that establishes a finding type.  To state this
      another way, there is no point to having a finding type that is
      not reported by an analysis tool. Each finding has one and only
      one finding type. Users of Sierra typically deal with finding
      types and rarely need to be aware of artifact types.</para>

      <para>Sierra groups findings into categories.  A
      <emphasis>category</emphasis> is defined by a set of finding
      types.  Sierra groups scan findings into categories by examining
      the finding type of each finding and placing it into the correct
      categories.  Categories are not required to be a partition of
      the set of finding categories, i.e., a finding type can be used
      to define two or more categories or no categories.  Sierra users
      can create and modify categories on a Sierra team server.  The
      team server allows categories to be defined in terms of other
      categories as well as by finding types.  User created categories
      can be shared with both Eclipse users and other Sierra team
      servers.  Sierra contains a large number of defined "stock"
      categories.</para>

      <para>Armed with an understanding of what Sierra defines an
      artifact, a finding, and a category to be, we now return to what
      happens during a scan with the purpose introducing the concept
      of a scan filter.  When a scan is performed several steps occur
      within Sierra.  First the analysis tools are run.  These tools
      produce a scan document.  Next this scan document is loaded into
      a database.  While the scan document is loaded, findings are
      matched and created and a scan filter is applied.  A
      <emphasis>scan filter</emphasis> is the mechanism to control
      what finding types are deemed important to report to the user.
      The scan filter also controls at what level of importance each
      finding is reported.  A scan filter is therefore a set of
      categories and/or finding types with an importance level.  When
      the scan filter is applied as the scan document is loaded into
      the database it filters out all finding types that are not
      included by the scan filter.  Sierra allows users to create and
      modify scan filters on a Sierra team server.  Scan filters can
      be shared with both Eclipse clients and other Sierra team
      servers.  The Sierra Eclipse client has one special scan filter,
      called the <emphasis>local scan filter</emphasis>, that can be
      edited within Eclipse.  This scan filter is required if the
      client is not connected to a Sierra team server, e.g.,
      stand-alone use of the Sierra Eclipse client.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Client scan model:</emphasis> The Sierra Eclipse
      client stores two scans of each project: the most recent, or
      current, scan and the previous scan.  This model allows the
      client to "diff" the two scans and report to the user what has
      changed.  In the Sierra Eclipse client, Java projects may be
      connected to one and only one Sierra team server.  When a Java
      project is connected to a team server, it is possible to publish
      scans to that team server from Eclipse.  The scan filter used
      for a scan run from the Sierra Eclipse client depends upon if
      the Java project scanned is connected to a team server or not.
      If the project is connected to a team server, then the scan
      filter defined by that team server is used.  If the project is
      not connected to a team server, then the local scan filter is
      used.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Team server scan model:</emphasis> The Sierra
      team server stores all uploaded scans. Scans can be uploaded
      from Eclipse clients or from Ant scripts.  The team server
      allows a particular scan filter to be assigned to each Java
      project.  A default scan filter is set for the team server and
      is used for any Java project that does not have an explicit scan
      filter set for it.</para>

      <para>When a scan is uploaded to a team server from Eclipse or
      Ant, it is the scan document that is sent to the team server
      (not the filtered in-database version of the scan).  Thus, the
      scan filter on the team server is applied to the uploaded scan
      document as it it loaded into the team server's database.  This
      means, in some cases, that a different scan filter can be
      applied on the client than on the team server.  For example, if
      an unconnected project is scanned on an Eclipse client then the
      local scan filter of that client is applied to that scan.  If
      that project is subsequently connected to a team server and the
      scan is published (i.e., uploaded) from the client to that team
      server then the default scan filter for that team server is
      applied to the scan.  In this example, two different scan filters
      where applied and they may not be the same.  This issue can be a
      source of confusion, but, as described below, Sierra tries to
      minimize this confusion by using the server scan filter for
      client scans of all projects that are connected to a team
      server.</para>

      <para>When a client connects a Java project to a team server,
      category and scan filter information is transferred down to the
      client.  This transfer allows the connected Java project on the
      client to use the same scan filter it would use on the team
      server.  This helps to keep the scan filter consistent on client
      connected to a team server.  To keep scan results consistent it
      is recommend that a new scan be run after each project is
      connected to a team server from an Eclipse client.</para>

      <para>Why do the client and server use different scan models?
      This is primarily due to the different roles they serve in the
      overall Sierra system.  The client is intended for deep
      investigation of current scan findings.  Users of the client are
      engaged in auditing findings and fixing them in their source
      code.  There is little purpose for saving dozens of scans on the
      client and doing this could take up significant disk space on
      that client user's desktop computer.  The server is intended to
      support team collaboration and reporting.  The server needs to
      be able to produce longitudinal reports and therefore needs to
      save the results of a large number of scans.</para>

      <para><emphasis>BugLink vs. ScanLink data:</emphasis> A Sierra
      team server holds two different kinds of data: BugLink and
      ScanLink. BugLink data includes artifact definitions, finding
      type definitions, category definitions, and scan
      filters. ScanLink data includes scan data (findings and
      artifacts), audit data, code metrics data, and any other
      analysis results about code.  Why this distinction between types
      of data?  Because Sierra supports multiple team servers across
      an organization. BugLink data can be transferred between team
      servers and ScanLink data can't (ScanLink data is transferred
      between clients and a team server).  Team servers can share
      category and scan filter definitions, but they can't share scans
      and audits.</para>

      <para>All Sierra team servers hold BugLink data, but only some
      hold ScanLink data.  This allows some team servers to be
      purposed as a repository for category and scan filter
      information within an organization without hosting the scan and
      audit data for any projects.</para>

	<para>A dialog will open showing you the set of available Java
	projects that you can scan. Check the projects you want to scan or
	press the <guibutton>Select All</guibutton> button to check them
	all and then press the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button to start
	the scan. Equivalently, you could right-click a selected set of
	open Java projects in the <guilabel>Package Explorer</guilabel>
	and from the <guimenu>Sierra</guimenu> menu select the
	<guimenuitem>Scan Project</guimenuitem> menu item.</para>

	<para>You will receive notification via a balloon that the scan
	has been started and will run in the background. As the scan on
	each project completes another balloon will notify you.</para>

	<para>After one or more scans have completed running, you can
	change to the <guilabel>Code Review</guilabel> perspective to
	examine the results. To do this, select the <guimenuitem>Open Code
	Review Perspective</guimenuitem> menu item from the
	<guimenu>Sierra</guimenu> menu. The Eclipse layout will change to
	show views which will help you to examine the findings the scan
	reported.</para>

	<para>By default all findings are shown (up to a cutoff limit of 500, by default, which
	you may change). However, the <guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel> view allows
	you to select what findings are of interest to you. For example,
	if you select <guibutton>Project</guibutton> you will see your
	results partitioned by project. The
	<guilabel>Results</guilabel> view shows the list of findings you have
	filtered down to. Selecting a results in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view
	shows details about that individual result in
	the <guilabel>Finding Details</guilabel> view.</para>

	<para>Small orange <guiicon><inlinegraphic
	fileref="images/asterisk-orange.png" /></guiicon> icons appear
	in the Java editor gutter to highlight tool findings. By
	default, these gutter icons only appear for findings deemed of
	high or critical importance.</para>

	<para>If you click on a finding in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view or in the Java editor that finding will be shown
	in the <guilabel>Finding Details</guilabel> view. This view allows
	you to read about the finding and interact with the finding. One
	change that can be made is to the importance of the
	finding.</para>

	<para>Double check that the project compiles

	<para>Now run a Sierra scan on the code. To do this
	choose the
	<guimenuitem>Scan Project</guimenuitem> menu item from the
	<guimenu>Sierra</guimenu> menu item in the Eclipse main menu.
	Alternatively, you can right-click on
	the <application>SierraTutorial_ShowOff</application> project (not the Java file)
	in the <guilabel>Package Explorer</guilabel> and from the
	<guimenu>Sierra</guimenu> menu (likely way down toward the bottom) select the <guimenuitem>Scan
	Project</guimenuitem> menu item. Either way a <guilabel>Scan Project</guilabel>
	dialog should appear as shown below.</para>

	<para>You want to do this so click

	by selecting the <guimenuitem>Open Code Review
	Perspective</guimenuitem> menu item from the
	<guimenu>Sierra</guimenu> menu. The Eclipse layout will change
	to show views which will help you examine the findings the
	scan reported.</para>

	<para>All the findings in your local database are shown when, as
	in the screenshot above, the filter is off.  These are listed
	in the <guilabel>Findings</guilabel> view at the bottom-left.
	The view cuts off at 500 findings, but this preference can be changed.
	You can tell that all the findings are displayed because the text at the
	bottom of the list states <guilabel>5 Findings</guilabel>. If the cutoff were
	in use then the text would state the list is limited to 500 by displaying
	<guilabel><inlinegraphic fileref="images/warning.gif" />Showing 500
	of all possible findings</guilabel>. Further, this text would be underlined to indicate
	that it hyperlinks to the
	preference page for Sierra. Thus, you can increase the cutoff value if you wish.</para>

	<para>The <guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel> view at
	the top of the perspective allows you to "drill-into" findings
	along several dimensions. It is a powerful control but is
	straightforward to use. For this tutorial, first click on
	<guibutton>Importance</guibutton> then check
	<guibutton>High</guibutton>. Notice that these actions change the list
	of findings
	displayed in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view. At this point, one
	findings should be listed. Select the finding
	shown in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view. Selecting this finding
	will bring up its information in the <guilabel>Finding
	Details</guilabel> view. In addition, the Java editor will
	highlight the offending line of code. Your screen should now
	look like <xref linkend="fig-tutorial-screenshot-showoff-finding" />. If you
	get more than one finding, you probably have scanned other
	projects. (To delete the data from these projects see <xref

	<para>Read the description in the <guilabel>Finding

	addition, you can click the line references in the
	<guilabel>Location</guilabel> portion of the tab to examine
	the lines of code referenced by this finding to help you understand
	why the tool reported it.  This high
	importance finding is about a possible null dereference, and
	these lines represent code that would be executed before
	the null dereference.  It was noticed because
	the <function>box</function> method checks
	if <varname>o</varname> is null but then later, regardless of
	the outcome of this check, dereferences it. This is clearly a
	problem, and if you run the code the second call from the
	<function>main</function> method indeed causes a failure in
	the program: the call prints <literal>null</literal> and then
	throws a <varname>NullPointerException</varname> to the
	console.</para>

	<para>To fix this problem add a <literal>return</literal>

	<para>(To show line numbers in the Eclipse editor you
	right-click in the left-hand margin of the editor and check
	<guimenuitem>Show Line Numbers</guimenuitem>.)</para>

	<para>Now save your change and scan the project again. The finding
	seems to disappear, however, the tool knows it has been
	fixed.</para>

	<para>In the <guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel> clear
	your current search by pressing the <guiicon><inlinegraphic
	fileref="images/asterisk-grey-x.png" /></guiicon> icon in the
	far upper-right of the view.  This clears the filter and lets
	all the findings through to the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view.</para>
	
	  <mediaobject>
	    <imageobject>
	      <imagedata fileref="images/tutorial-remove-whole-filter.png" />
	    </imageobject>
	  </mediaobject>	
	
	<para>You can also clear
	just a particular filter (and all the subsequent filters to its right) by using the <inlinegraphic

	      <imagedata fileref="images/tutorial-remove-part-filter.png" />
	    </imageobject>
	  </mediaobject>	
	
	<para>In this case you can use either approach because there is only one filter. Next, select
	<guibutton>Status</guibutton> and check <guibutton>Fixed</guibutton> to see the finding you just
	fixed appear back in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view. Sierra works hard to remember findings across scans. It
	does this by matching findings reported in each scan (The
	matching heuristic used by the tool is not perfect but will work
	most of the time, however, aggressive code changes might throw
	it off).</para>

	<para>In the <guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel> clear
	your current search again by pressing the
	<guiicon><inlinegraphic fileref="images/asterisk-grey-x.png"
	/></guiicon> icon in the upper-right of the view (or instead
	of clearing the query just select
	<guibutton>Importance</guibutton> in the far left pane of the
	view which will change the current query). Select
	<guibutton>Importance</guibutton> and then right click on the
	bar chart and select <guibutton>Select All</guibutton> from
	the context menu. This is a quick way to select all the items
	listed. Select <guibutton>Audited</guibutton> and check the
	two items listed (Yes and No) to see all the findings from the
	most recent scan in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view.</para>

	<para>Select the first finding shown. It warns that all classes
	and interfaces should belong to a named package.  This is not a
	finding we care about for this project so we can audit
	it. Right-click on the finding in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view and via the <guimenuitem>Set
	Importance</guimenuitem> context menu select
	<guimenuitem>Irrelevant</guimenuitem> to change the importance of
	the finding.</para>

	<para>This action, which we call auditing the finding, causes
	several things to occur. First, if you examine the counts bar
	chart for <guibutton>Audited</guibutton> you will note that one
	finding has now been audited and the others have not. If you uncheck and
	then check <guibutton>No</guibutton> (a checkbox under the
	<guibutton>Audited</guibutton> filter) you can see the other two
	findings in the list go away and then return. Second, in the
	<guilabel>Finding Details</guilabel> view the audit tab shows one
	audit.</para>

	<para>Click on the audit tab (the middle tab) in the
	<guilabel>Finding Details</guilabel> view. The change of the
	finding's importance has been time-stamped and logged. Let's note
	that we want to use the default package using another audit. Type
	"The default package is OK for ShowOff." and press the
	<guibutton>Add</guibutton> button.</para>

	<para>Now the finding has two audits and both are time-stamped. If
	you were using a Sierra team server then audits by your team would
	appear in this audit list as well as audits made by you. When an
	audit is synchronized with a Sierra team server, the name of who
	made the audit changes from <emphasis>Local</emphasis> to the name
	for that user on the team server. A team server helps your team
	collaborate on finding audits, however, collaboration is not the
	focus of this tutorial so we will continue without connecting to a
	Sierra team server.</para>

	<para>We probably do not want to see findings that we have
	marked as <guibutton>Irrelevant</guibutton> in our list of
	results. So in the <guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel>
	click the underlined <guibutton>Importance</guibutton>
	"breadcrumb" (one of the underlined words at the top of the
	view) to scroll the view over to the importance
	selections.</para>
	
	  <mediaobject>
	    <imageobject>
	      <imagedata fileref="images/tutorial-breadcrumb.png" />
	    </imageobject>
	  </mediaobject>	
	  	
	<para>The breadcrumbs allow easy scrolling of the view
	to areas that might be off the screen. Uncheck
	<guibutton>Irrelevant</guibutton> and then examine the state
	of the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view. The one irrelevant
	finding is now filtered out of the
	set of findings shown.</para>

	<para>Let's examine the three remaining findings. Click the
	first one in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view, <emphasis>All methods are static. Consider
	using a utility class instead</emphasis>, to bring it up in the <guilabel>Finding
	Details</guilabel> view and highlight the issue in the Java editor. This finding notes that the class may follow
	the utility design pattern and you should consider creating a private constructor to avoid the creation of
	any objects of this type. We are are not concerned with this finding
	so audit it to be <guilabel>Irrelevant</guilabel>.</para>
	
	<para>Again, select the first finding in the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view,
	<emphasis>Avoid appending characters as strings in StringBuffer.append</emphasis>.
	This finding notes
	that you could append a character rather than a string. This
	change would result in a slight performance improvement in our
	code. To fix it change
	<computeroutput>line.append("-")</computeroutput> to
	<computeroutput>line.append('-')</computeroutput>. Next we want to
	indicate our work in the audit trail for this finding.</para>

	<figure id="fig-tutorial-audits">
	  <title>Three audits have been performed on this finding</title>
	  <mediaobject>
	    <imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/tutorial-audits.png"/></imageobject>
	  </mediaobject>
	</figure>

	<para>In the <emphasis>Finding Details</emphasis> view open the
	audit tab and click on the large stamp image in the upper-left. This
	creates an audit entry that states, "I examined this finding." and
	is a quick way to note that you examined this finding. Since we
	want to note that we have edited the code, type "I fixed this in
	the code." and then press the <emphasis>Add</emphasis> button to
	add a second audit.</para>

	<para>Before we leave this finding let's set its importance to
	<emphasis>Low</emphasis>. In this small program such a minor
	performance improvement is likely not a big deal. We could
	just change the radio button at the left, but let's use the
	drop down in the upper-left of the view. Press the drop down
	and change the importance. Notice that this changes the views
	to reflect the new importance and adds a third audit entry to
	reflect that you made this change. The state of this finding
	can be seen in <xref linkend="fig-tutorial-audits" />.</para>

	<para>Now let's examine the last finding by selecting it in
	the <guilabel>Results</guilabel> view, <emphasis>Avoid instantiating
	String objects; this is usually unnecessary</emphasis>.
	The finding should be at the bottom of the list. This
	finding is complaining about our use of <computeroutput>new
	String("hello")</computeroutput> in the code at line 10. Explicit use of
	string construction is considered bad practice in Java as it
	can force the Java virtual machine to make extra copies of
	strings.</para>

	<figure id="fig-tutorial-artifacts">
	  <title>Two tool artifacts have been combined to create this finding</title>

	  </mediaobject>
	</figure>

	<para>In the <guilabel>Finding Details</guilabel> view select the
	artifacts tab (the last tab to the right) note that this finding
	has two artifacts. This finding is made up of two tool reports:
	one from FindBugs and one from PMD. The two artifacts that
	establish this finding can be seen in <xref
	linkend="fig-tutorial-artifacts" />.</para>

	<para>In Sierra, reports from analysis tools are called
	artifacts. Sierra works to merge artifacts that are really about
	the same problem into one finding. One can think of artifacts as
	raw tool results and findings as what Sierra creates based upon
	those raw tool results.  One other difference between artifacts
	and findings is that findings exist across scans while an artifact
	is connected to one and only one scan.</para>

	<para>To fix this finding change the code from
	<computeroutput>box(new String("hello"))</computeroutput> to
	<computeroutput>box("hello")</computeroutput> and then scan the
	project one final time.</para>

	<para>When the scan is completed the <guilabel>Findings</guilabel> view
	will update to show no findings. This
	indicates that no new findings have been found and the two we
	were working on have been fixed. Clear the search in the
	<guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel> view by pressing the
	<guiicon><inlinegraphic
	fileref="images/asterisk-grey-x.png" /></guiicon>
	icon and press <guibutton>Status</guibutton> to see that two
	findings have been fixed and two findings are unchanged as seen in
	<xref linkend="fig-tutorial-status-fixed" />.</para>

	<para>This tutorial has introduced basic use of the Sierra Eclipse
	client to audit Java code. You should now try Sierra on your own
	code and we encourage you to explore and make Sierra work the way
	you want it to.</para>

	<para>Before we move on to the next tutorial we want to delete
	the ShowOff project from the Sierra database. This is done via
	the Sierra preferences. Select <guimenu>Window</guimenu> |

      <section id="sec-tutorial-team-server">
	<title>Interacting with a Sierra team server</title>

	<para>This tutorial assumes that you have installed Sierra and

	<para>SmallWorld is a Java text-oriented adventure game. The

	another computer wants to connect to your local team server then
	they cannot use <emphasis>localhost</emphasis> as the host. They
	will need to enter the IP address of your machine. The rest of the
	connection settings should be the same, except, of course, that
	they should probably have a different user name and password. Next
	we will connect the SmallWorld project to this server.</para>

	<para>A project can be connected to one and only one team server
	at a time. You can disconnect and reconnect the project to another
	team server, however, all the local data in your Eclipse client
	will be deleted when you perform the disconnect. The reason for
	this is that once you start sharing scans and audit information
	with that server your local data becomes coupled with the data of
	that team server.</para>

	<para>The client does allow you to edit the properties of a server
	connection to reference another team server. This works if the
	name or IP address of that server was changed (for any reason) on
	your network. It also works if the server database you were
	connecting to was moved from one server to another. It also works
	if your user name or password need to be updated (as we shall
	demonstrate later in this tutorial using the
	<emphasis>troll</emphasis> user). Sierra checks on each
	client-server command that the client and servers databases are
	the expected ones.</para>

	<para>To connect the SmallWorld project to the local server
	right-click on the server name and select <guimenuitem>Connect
	Projects...</guimenuitem> from the context menu. Check the

	<para>A very useful feature of a team server is that it can
	store the scan filter for your team. A scan filter defines the
	types of results your team has deemed completely without
	merit. These results are filtered out of the scan. For more
	information about setting up a scan filter see <xref
	linkend="sec-preferences-scan-filter" />. To send your scan
	filter to the server right-click on the server name and select
	the <emphasis>Send Local Scan Filter As...</emphasis> menu
	item from the context menu. A dialog appear prompting you for
	a name to save the scan filter with on the server as shown in
	<xref linkend="fig-tutorial-send-scan-filter" />. Enter
	<userinput>Tutorial</userinput> and press
	<guibutton>Send</guibutton> to continue. The local server now
	has a copy, the same scan filter as your client. You should see
	this copy of the scan filter in the <guilabel>Team
	Server</guilabel> under the Scan Filters portion of your local
	server, it will be called
	<emphasis>Tutorial</emphasis>.</para>

	<para>Other members of your team get the scan filter settings
	from the team server. We don't need to download them since we
	just uploaded them, however, for practice we will. To download
	and use the Tutorial scan filter stored on the local server
	you right-click on the scan filter name and select
	<emphasis>Copy to Local Scan Filter</emphasis> from the
	context menu as shown in <xref
	linkend="fig-tutorial-copy-scan-filter" />. A dialog will warn
	that this will replace the scan filter currently on your
	client. Press <emphasis>Yes</emphasis> to continue.</para>

	</figure>

	<para>The reason it is important to keep the scan filter
	consistent between your clients and your server is that if you
	have different scan filters you can see different analysis
	results. For example, if the server filters out findings about
	null pointers and your client does not then you will see more
	findings on the client than you do on your server. To understand
	why this is true you need to understand a bit about how scans
	work.</para>

	<para>A project scan (via Eclipse or via Ant) creates a scan
	document file. You can see these files in your
	<filename>.sierra-data</filename> directory. For the
	SmallWorld project you will see the
	<filename>SmallWorld.sierra.gz</filename> scan document
	file. This file contains the tool reports about the SmallWorld
	project. When a scan is loaded into the client database your
	local scan filter is applied.  When you publish your
	SmallWorld scan to your server the scan document file is sent
	to the server, which allows the server to apply its scan
	filter.</para>

	<para>When you connect a project to a server, as we have done
	with SmallWorld. That project stops using the local client
	scan filter and starts using the one assigned to it by the
	team server. If you drill into the SmallWorld project in the
	<guilabel>Team Servers</guilabel> view you can see that
	SmallWorld is assigned <emphasis>Scan filter: Defaults for
	local server</emphasis>.  This assignment is done on the
	portal.</para>

	<para>We will now edit the Tutorial scan filter on the portal
	and assign it to the connected SmallWorld project. In your web
	browser log back into the portal as the
	<userinput>zork</userinput> user. Select the <guilabel>Scan
	Filters</guilabel> tab and then select the
	<emphasis>Tutorial</emphasis> scan filter in the list at the
	left.  This scan filter is defined in terms of finding types,
	let's define it with just a few focused categories. To do this
	we will first delete the scan filter and then build it from
	scratch.  Press the <emphasis>Delete</emphasis> link at the
	upper-right to delete the scan filter.  Next, press the
	<guibutton>Create a Scan Filter</guibutton> button at the
	upper-left and enter <userinput>Tutorial</userinput> and press
	<guibutton>Create</guibutton>. The new scan filter will be
	created.</para>

	<para>Select the now empty <emphasis>Tutorial</emphasis> scan
	filter in the list at the left. Select the
	<emphasis>Edit</emphasis> link a the upper-right to edit the
	Tutorial scan filter.  Select the <emphasis>Add
	Category</emphasis> link. In the dialog that opens select
	<userinput>Correctness</userinput> and
	<userinput>Performance</userinput> as shown in
	<xref linkend="fig-tutorial-portal-scan-filter-add-categories"

	shown. What is the reason for these apparent inconsistencies?
	The reason is that Sierra categories are not a partition of
	the finding types.  It is possible for a finding type to be in
	one or more categories.  In this case there is overlap. To see
	this, add the <guilabel>Finding Type</guilabel> filter after
	the <guilabel>Finding Category</guilabel> and check and
	uncheck each finding category one at at time. Note that
	<emphasis>Should be static</emphasis> finding type is in both
	the <emphasis>Design Rules (PMD)</emphasis> and the
	<emphasis>Performance (FindBugs)</emphasis> categories. In
	addition, the <emphasis>Superfluous instanceof</emphasis>
	finding type is in both the <emphasis>Correctness
	(FindBugs)</emphasis> and <emphasis>Style
	(FindBugs)</emphasis> categories. Go back and show the three
	<emphasis>Performance (FindBugs)</emphasis> findings.</para>

	<para>Check all the categories and select
	<guilabel>Show</guilabel> to see the four findings. The two
	findings about changing the anonymous inner classes to named
	static classes we consider unimportant for this
	program. Change the importance of these two findings to
	Irrelevant by selecting both and using the context
	menu.</para>

	<para>One of the findings suggests that the
	<varname>f_description</varname> field can be declared
	static. Looking at the code of this class it is clear that
	this field can be removed from the class, i.e., the string
	literal could simply be returned from the
	<varname>getDescription()</varname> method.  This can be
	deemed a minor problem. First, change the importance of this
	finding to low and enter an audit that states:</para>
	
	<blockquote>
	  <para>Remove this field and simply return the string literal
	  "Our Hero" from the getDescription() method.</para>
	</blockquote>

	<para>You have now made a few audits that you can share with
	the team server. To do this select <guimenu>Sierra</guimenu> |
	<guimenuitem>Synchronize All</guimenuitem> from the Eclipse

	the audit is attributed to changed from

	<para>This preference page is used to configure the appearance
	of and many general settings about the Sierra Eclipse client.</para>

	<para>The settings that may be configured are described below:</para>

	<para>The <emphasis>Data directory</emphasis> sets where
	Sierra stores scan data and logs. In addition, the
	<filename>server</filename> subdirectory of the data directory
	is used to store all data for the Local Team Server. All
	Sierra data goes into the data directory except the local
	Database which is stored under the current Eclipse
	workspace. This location is relative to your workspace and cannot be changed.</para>

	<para>The <emphasis>Appearance</emphasis> group contains the
	following settings:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Maximum number of findings shown in
	    'Sierra Quick Search' results:</emphasis> This setting
	    limits the number of findings that the <emphasis>Findings
	    Quick Search</emphasis> view will show. This setting ensures
	    that Eclipse doesn't run out of memory trying to display a
	    gigantic set of analysis findings.</para>

	    <para>The default value for this setting is 2000, however,
	    it can be raised if Eclipse is given a large amount of
	    memory. A warning is shown in the <emphasis>Findings Quick
	    Search</emphasis> view if a list is truncated.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Show 'balloon' notifications for scan start
	    and completion.</emphasis> This setting controls if balloon
	    notifications pop up when a scan is run.</para>

	    (notifications are shown).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Prompt to change to the Code Review
	    perspective on scan completion.</emphasis> This setting

	    user is prompted).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>If no prompt, automatically change to the
	    Code Review perspective.</emphasis> If the previous
	    setting is false (no user prompt) then this setting
	    controls if the perspective is automatically changed to
	    the <guilabel>Code Review</guilabel> perspective when a
	    scan has completed.</para>

	    <para>The default value for this setting is checked (the

	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Allow the user to select the set of
	    projects to scan even when projects are selected in the
	    Package Explorer.</emphasis> This setting controls if the
	    dialog is shown to allow the user to select projects when
	    the user performs a scan or publish. If this setting is
	    checked then the dialog always appears even if projects
	    are selected in the Package Explorer. If this setting is
	    not checked then the dialog will only appear when no
	    projects are selected in the Package Explorer.</para>

	    <para><emphasis>Show markers for findings in the Java
	    editor (requires Eclipse restart).</emphasis> This setting
	    turns on or off the * markers that highlight tool findings
	    in the gutter of the Java editor. This setting must be
	    checked for the next setting to be taken into account by
	    Sierra.</para>

	    for showing markers in the gutter of the Java editor.</para>

	    <para>The default value of this setting is
	    <emphasis>High</emphasis> meaning that only findings of High
	    or Critical importance are highlighted in the gutter of the
	    Java editor.</para>
	  </listitem>

	<para>The <emphasis>Code Scanning</emphasis> settings are used
	when code scans are performed by Sierra from within
	Eclipse. This group contains the following settings:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Maximum VM memory allowed for
	    scans:</emphasis> Code scans run in a separate Java
	    VM. This preference controls the maximum memory used by
	    code scan processes.</para>

	    <para>The default value for this setting is 1024 MB. The
	    maximum value for your computer is shown in the
	    dialog. This maximum value for this setting is difficult
	    to determine and is different on each computer
	    configuration due to technical limitations in Java VM
	    implementations.  Sierra calculates this maximum for your
	    computer configuration as best it can and limits your
	    setting based upon the results of this
	    calculation. However, it is possible, in rare cases, that
	    too large a value for your computer configuration could be
	    set. In this case the scan will abort right away and you
	    should get an indication of what the problem is.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Save all modified resources automatically
	    prior to starting a scan.</emphasis> This indicates that
	    any unsaved resources in the workspace are automatically
	    saved prior to a scan without prompted the user.</para>

	    <para>The default value for this setting is unchecked (the
	    user is prompted to save resources prior to a scan

      <title>License management</title>

      <para>Sierra is commercial software and a license is required to
      use it. Licenses are obtained from SureLogic and expire after
      some period of time. Lack of a license will prohibit you from
      running scans. It is still possible to examine data from prior
      scans (which can be useful if your license expires). Selecting
      <guimenuitem>Manage SureLogic Licenses</guimenuitem> from the
      Sierra menu brings up the license management form as seen in
      <xref linkend="fig-license-management" />. (It is also possible
      to bring this dialog up from the main Sierra preferences pane by
      pressing the <guibutton>Manage SureLogic Licenses</guibutton>
      button.) For Sierra to operate properly either a
      <emphasis>Sierra</emphasis> or <emphasis>All Tools</emphasis>
      license must be installed.</para>

      <figure id="fig-license-management">
	<title>The SureLogic license management dialog</title>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/license-management.png"/></imageobject>
	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>By default license installation requires internet access.
      SureLogic can, in special cases, provide licenses that do not
      require internet access. Further use of the product does not
      require internet access. If a manual uninstall is done, before
      license expiration, internet access is also required.  SureLogic
      tracks the number of times a particular license is installed and
      uninstalled. We stress that Sierra does not, unlike other
      plug-ins such as MyEclipse, "talk-back" to SureLogic each time
      Eclipse is started.</para>

      <para>The installed license expires after a period of time
      (clearly visible to the user) and a new license has to
      be installed to continue to use Sierra.</para>

      <para>Licenses can be installed more than once.  Thus, one
      license can be used for all of an organization or SureLogic can
      issue one per location or one per organizational entity.</para>

      <para>If the Sierra Eclipse plug-in does not have a valid
      license it will not effect the Eclipse installation that Sierra
      is installed into. The IDE will load and function normally, but
      when Sierra functions are executed they will fail noting the
      lack of a license. Serviceability functions of the tool (e.g.,
      sending problem reports to SureLogic, installing and
      uninstalling licenses) function properly without a license.  The
      unlicensed Sierra plug-in can be uninstalled or disabled within
      Eclipse.</para>

      <para>When you receive a license file from SureLogic it is
      installed via this dialog.  To install the license select the
      row in the license table that matches the type of license.  For
      example, if you have been sent a Sierra license select the
      Sierra row in the license table.  Next press the
      <guibutton>Install License</guibutton> button.  You will be
      prompted for the location of your license file.  The tool checks
      with SureLogic and reports that your license has been installed
      and returns showing information about the installed license. The
      license file is not examined by the tool after the installation
      is completed unless you install the file again (after an
      uninstall).</para>

      <para>To uninstall a license, select the row in the license
      table and press the <guibutton>Uninstall
      License</guibutton>. You will be asked if you are sure you want
      to uninstall the license.  If you confirm the uninstall then the
      license is removed.  This may take a minute as SureLogic is
      informed that your license has been uninstalled.</para>

      <para>When a license is nearing expiration the tool warns the
      user with the dialog shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-license-management-expiration-warning" />.</para>

      <figure id="fig-license-management-expiration-warning">

      </figure>

      <para>When a license does expire it disappears from the dialog.
      The tool is considered unlicensed at that point. To fix this
      situation install a new license (it is not required to install a
      new version of Sierra).</para>

      SureLogic. If a proxy is used on your network then it is
      critical to configure Eclipse to use it.  To do this open the

      <para>Sierra provides two tasks that can be used to extend
      <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</ulink>. The
      Sierra Ant tasks may be downloaded from <ulink
      url="http://www.surelogic.com/static/sierra/sierra-ant.zip">
      http://www.surelogic.com/static/sierra/sierra-ant.zip</ulink>. Unzip
      them to any location on your disk. The archive will create a
      <filename>sierra-ant</filename> directory.</para>


      <para>The below code shows and example of adding the Sierra
      tasks into Ant.</para>

						<emphasis>Java 8 language and virtual machine support</emphasis> &mdash;
						This release of Sierra
						fully supports the Java 8 programming
						language and virtual machine. The
						tool also supports scanning older
						Java programs on a Java 8 virtual machine. To launch Java 8
						programs a
						version of Eclipse that
						supports Java 8, e.g., Eclipse
						Luna (4.4) or above, is required.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Updated analysis tools</emphasis> &mdash;
						FindBugs has been updated to version 3.0.0. PMD has been updated
						to
						version 5.1.1. These updates
						featured support for the Java 8
						programming language.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Updated web portal library</emphasis> &mdash;
						The Sierra portal has been updated to version 2.6.1 of GWT. This
						update
						should help with browser support as well as bug fixes to the
						web
						infrastructure.
					</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis><guilabel>Findings Quick Search</guilabel> split into two new views: <guilabel>Sierra Quick Search</guilabel> and <guilabel>Results</guilabel></emphasis> &mdash;
						The Sierra results display has been split into two views to improve usability of the tool. In particular, you can turn off the filter and simply
						show all tool results.

						<emphasis>Support for IBM Jazz source control</emphasis> &mdash;
						The source
						control component of the IBM Jazz technology platform manages the source
						code,
						documents, and other artifacts that a team creates. The code is stored on a
						server
						and accessed as a URL by clients. This created a problem for Sierra
						which, prior to
						this release, expected the source code and binary artifacts of a
						project to exist
						as files on a local or remote filesystem. Changes were made to
						Sierra in this release to support
						IBM Jazz source control. Similar server-based URL-oriented systems
						should also be supported by Sierra.
