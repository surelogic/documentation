  <title>Method Effects</title>
        
  <para>Regions provide an abstract way to name the state of an
  object. The effects of a method&mdash;the state read and written
  during the execution of that method&mdash;may be expressed in terms
  of regions. Effects are useful when determining whether code can be
  reordered by a refactoring, and are also necessary to support the
  analyses that assure <classname>@Unique</classname> and
  <classname>@RegionLock</classname> annotations.</para>
