    <title>Release notes</title>
    <para>For each release of JSure there are new and noteworthy
    features to try out, and known limitations to avoid or
    workaround. These are presented in the sections below for each
    released version of JSure.</para>

          <emphasis>Reorganization of JSure menu</emphasis>
          &mdash;
          To make the JSure menu simpler to use we have reorganized it. Items are better grouped
          by use. This was driven, in part, by several changes to the tool are discussed below.
          The top section contains commands to operate JSure in Eclipse.
          The second section contains commands that import or export files.
          The third section contains commands to send feedback to SureLogic and run the JSure
          tutorials.
          The last section contains a command to open a dialog to manage your tool license.

            <emphasis>Improved Ant task</emphasis>
            &mdash;
            Several changes to the JSure Ant task are included in this version. If you use the Ant task you'll
            have to make some changes to your scripts. If not, the improvements made in this tool release
            may make the task useful in your development environment. A summary of the changes is listed below.
          </para>
          <orderedlist>
          <listitem><para>The task is no longer included in the Eclipse distribution. It must be downloaded <ulink url="http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse/install.html#cl">here</ulink>
          on the surelogic website. The reason for this change is to reduce the Eclipse tool distribution size. When adding the Ant task, JSure doubles in size, with Ant and Maven it is
          3X the download size. Now folks can download only what they need.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>The task has been simplified. It is still similar to the Ant <ulink url="https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/javac.html">javac</ulink> task
          but now has simpler setup.</para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem><para>Output from the Ant task is a Zip file that can be loaded into Eclipse. The name of the file encodes
          the information needed to load it into Eclipse.</para>

          </orderedlist>
          <para>This approach is also intended to be supported in Maven but the Maven plugin for JSure is not yet complete. Further we plan to use the
          Ant and Maven to support predicates on the tool results (e.g., all annotations are consistent with the code). This
          future work will enable automated use of JSure in a "back office" automated build.</para>

          to save a <filename>jsure-html-docs.zip</filename> file on your disk. Inside this Zip file is the
          HTML version of this documentation that you can open in your browser. Some users prefer this format
          because they can display it in the browser of their preference.

					<para>
						<emphasis>Region declarations can now be inferred by JSure</emphasis>
						&mdash;
						You can use <code>@InRegion</code> or <code>@UniqueInRegion</code> annotations
						to allow inference of <code>@Region</code> annotations. This allows you to have
						the tool infer the correct information to declare a region of state. The intent
						is to make <code>@RegionLock</code> as simple to use as <code>@GuardedBy</code>.
					</para>
					<para>
					The image below shows the Animator class prior to this change. The explicit region
					declaration is highlighted.</para>
					<mediaobject>
							<imageobject>
								<imagedata fileref="images/release-notes-560-before-ri.png" />
							</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
					<para>With this enhancement the code no longer needs this declaration as shown below.</para>
					<mediaobject>
							<imageobject>
								<imagedata fileref="images/release-notes-560-after-ri.png" />
							</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
					<para>The promise is inferred and shows up in the verification results as a virtual promise (marked with a V).</para>
					<mediaobject>
							<imageobject>
								<imagedata fileref="images/release-notes-560-after-ri-results.png" />
							</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
					<para>Of course, this feature is optional and the explicit declaration is still supported.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>New @TrackPartiallyInitialized annotation limits partially initialized object annotations in large existing codebases</emphasis>
						&mdash;
						The use of <code>@NonNull</code> on fields in an object now requires that class to be annotated <code>@TrackPartiallyInitialized</code>.
						This new annotation turns on checking of the class implementation and its superclass implementations to verify that dispatching during
						construction is annotated with <code>@Initialized(through)</code> annotations. Originally we did this analysis across the entire
						codebase but this proved tedious to annotate in large existing codebases. While you may place this annotation on any class you want it is only required if (a) the class
						contains <code>@NonNull</code> field or (b) a subclass of the class is annotated <code>@TrackPartiallyInitialized</code>.
					</para>
					<mediaobject>
							<imageobject>
								<imagedata fileref="images/release-notes-560-track-pi.png" />
							</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
					<para>In the example above the Animator class is required to be annotated <code>@TrackPartiallyInitialized</code> because its <code>f_startDirection</code>
					field is <code>@NonNull</code>. This also forces any superclasses to be annotated <code>@TrackPartiallyInitialized</code>. In this example, that is only
					java.lang.Object, which, as we can see below, is annotated <code>@TrackPartiallyInitialized</code>.</para>
					<mediaobject>
							<imageobject>
								<imagedata fileref="images/release-notes-560-track-pi-object.png" />
							</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
					<para>The tool will propose this annotation. So for many users this annotation can be edited in by the tool
					when you add <code>@NonNull</code> on one of the fields in your code. Just keep adding the proposed <code>@TrackPartiallyInitialized</code>
					promise to classes (goes up the class hierarchy) until no more proposals are made by the tool.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Uniqueness annotations simplified</emphasis>
						&mdash;
						The uniqueness verifying analysis is still turned off by default, however, if it is turned on in this release (via the JSure menu in Eclipse)
						you will note that is simpler to use and its results are more understandable. In addition the promises have been simplified as of this release.
						The changes include the following:
						The <code>@Borrowed</code> annotation no longer has an <code>allowReturn</code> attribute.
						The <code>@Immutable</code> annotation no longer applies to references.
						The <code>@BorrowedInRegion</code> and <code>@ReadOnly</code> promises has been removed.
						The <code>@Unique</code> annotation annotation no longer has an <code>allowRead</code> attribute.
						The <code>@UniqueInRegion</code> annotation annotation no longer has an <code>allowRead</code> attribute.
					</para>
					<para>We will continue to work to make this analysis more straightforward to use over the next several JSure releases. This analysis
					is very useful for verifying security and concurrency properties of a codebase.</para>
