    <para><emphasis>What is JSure?</emphasis> JSure is a model-based
    static analysis tool that helps developers answer the question
    &ldquo;Are my threads accessing shared state in a safe way?&rdquo;
    JSure provides positive assurance that correct locks are held when
    shared state is accessed. The tool uses a sound analysis, i.e., it
    is not based upon a rule-based analysis. This enables programmers
    to develop a high confidence that their code is &ldquo;thread
    safe,&rdquo; that is, that it satisfies state consistency
    requirements.</para>

    <para>More specifically, JSure verifies that Java class
    implementations are consistent with programmer design intent as
    expressed using Java annotations. Annotations make JSure
    scalable: Unannotated classes have no design intent to
    assure. Annotations may be inserted incrementally in critical
    classes.  Later, additional annotations may be added as required
    to assure additional classes.  Verification results are, however,
    whole program: some annotations place requirements on class
    clients, and thus, the behavior of a client class is assured even
    if that class has no annotations of its own.</para>
    
    <para>The JSure analysis engine is integrated into the Eclipse
    Java IDE.  This enables JSure scans to be run in the background
    within Eclipse and verification results to be examined by the tool
    user within the widely-used Eclipse Java IDE.</para>
