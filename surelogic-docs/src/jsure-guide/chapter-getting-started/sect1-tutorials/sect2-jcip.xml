	<title>Verifying thread safe and immutable classes</title>

	<para>
		In this tutorial we walk through the complete assurance of the
		<classname>JSureTutorial_ThreadSafeAndImmutable</classname>
		project using JSure. Specifically, we assure the implementation of
		several classes that make up a simple 2D drawing framework. This
		tutorial focuses on the effective use of the
		<code>@ThreadSafe</code>
		and
		<code>@Immutable</code>
		annotations from
		<emphasis>Java Concurrency In Practice</emphasis>
		by Goetz, et. al. (Addison-Wesley 2006).
