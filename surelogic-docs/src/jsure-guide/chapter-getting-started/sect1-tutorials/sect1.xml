  <title>Tutorials</title>

  <para>This section contains three tutorials demonstrating the use of
  JSure and SureLogic program annotations to assure the correct use of
  locks in three concurrent programs.  The first tutorial uses a small
  closed-world example to demonstrate the complete assurance of a
  class and its usage, starting with no annotations at all.  The
  second and third examples begin with a partially annotated program,
  and demonstrates more sophisticated concepts such as support for
  <package>java.util.concurrent</package> reader&ndash;writer
  locks.</para>

  <para>These tutorials assume that you have installed JSure. If you
  see a <guimenu>JSure</guimenu> menu item on your Eclipse main menu
  than you can assume it has been installed properly.  To follow along
  with the tutorials you will also need to add the BoundedFIFOJsure
  and PlanetBaronJSure projects to your workspace.  From the Eclipse
  main menu, choose
  <menuchoice><guimenu>JSure</guimenu><guimenuitem>Run JSure
  Tutorials</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and add the projects to your
  workspace as displayed in <xref
  linkend="fig-tutorial-installing-projects" /> and <xref
  linkend="fig-tutorial-jsure-install" />. Note that the
  PlanetBaronJSure and SimpleVariable projects will <emphasis>not</emphasis> compile
  without errors until you add the promises JAR file to the project's
  build path (as described below).</para>
